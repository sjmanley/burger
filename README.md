# burger
<br>
Created a "burger" logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a ORM. Used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
<br>
Whenever a user submits a "burger" name, the app will display the burger name on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
<br>
When the user clicks and devours it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
<br>
<br>
The burger stays in a database, whether devoured or not.
